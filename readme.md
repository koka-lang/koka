# Koka: a Functional Language with Effects

_Koka v2 is a research language that currently under heavy development with the new C backend_  
_Latest release_: v2.3.8, 2021-12-27 ([Install]).

<a href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#why-handlers"><img align="right" width="300" src="doc/snippet-yield.png" /></a>

Koka is a strongly typed functional-style language with effect types and handlers.

* The core of Koka consists of a small set of well-studied language features, like first-class functions, 
  a polymorphic type- and effect system, algebraic data types, and effect handlers. Each of these is 
  composable and avoid the addition of “special” extensions by being as general as possible. 
* Koka tracks the (side) _effects_ of every
  function in its type, where pure and effectful computations are
  distinguished. The precise effect typing gives Koka _rock-solid
  semantics_ backed by well-studied category theory, which makes Koka
  particularly easy to reason about for both humans and compilers.  
* _Effect handlers_ let you define advanced control abstractions,
  like exceptions, async/await, or probabilistic programs, 
  as a user library in a typed and composable way.
* [Perceus](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#why-perceus) is an advanced compilation method for reference counting.
  Together with [evidence passing][evidence], this lets Koka compile directly to C code _without needing
  a garbage collector or runtime system_. 
  Perceus also performs [reuse analysis](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#why-fbip) and optimizes
  functional-style programs to use in-place updates when possible.

To learn more:

* [Install] Koka and compile your first programs. 
* Read the [Koka book][kokabook] for a tour of the Koka language and its specification.
* Browse the [library documentation][libraries].
* Help with [development](#tasks)

# Install

Koka has [binary installers][install] for Windows (x64), macOS (x64, M1), Linux (x64, arm64), and FreeBSD (x64).  
For other platforms, you need to build the compiler from source.

# Build from Source

Koka has few dependencies and should build from source
without problems on most common platforms, e.g. Windows (including WSL), macOS, and
Unix. The following programs are required to build Koka:

* [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/) to run the Haskell compiler. 
  Use `curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh` 
  on Unix and macOS x64, or the binary [installer](https://get.haskellstack.org/stable/windows-x86_64-installer.exe) on Windows.
  On macOS M1, use `brew install haskell-stack --head` (and see the [build notes](#build-notes) below).  
* Optional: [vcpkg] to be able to link easily with C libraries. 
  Use `brew install vcpkg` on macOS. On other systems use the vcpkg [install][vcpkg]
  instructions (Koka can find vcpkg automatically if installed to `~/vcpkg`).
* Optional: [nodejs](http://nodejs.org) if using the Javascript backend.
* Optional: [emscripten] and [wasmtime] if using the Wasm backend.
* Optional: On Windows it is recommended to install the [clang][winclang] C compiler, or the [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) C compiler.

Now clone the repository and build the compiler as (note the `--recursive` flag):
```
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/koka-lang/koka
$ cd koka
$ stack update
$ stack build
$ stack exec koka
```
You can also use `stack build --fast` to build a debug version of the compiler.
Use `stack test --fast` to run the test-suite.

(See the [build notes](#build-notes) below for building macOS M1, or if you have issues when running- or installing `stack`).


## Create an Install Bundle

Koka can generate a binary install bundle that can be installed
on the local machine:
```
$ stack exec koka -- -e util/bundle
...
distribution bundle created.
  bundle : bundle/koka-v2.3.1-linux-x64.tar.gz
  cc     : gcc
  version: v2.3.1
```
This takes a while as it pre-compiles the standard libraries in three build
variants (`debug`, `drelease` (release with debug info), and `release`).
After generating the bundle, you can install it locally as:
```
$ util/install.sh  bundle/koka-v2.3.1-linux-x64.tar.gz
```
(use `util/install.bat` on Windows). 
After installation, you can now directly invoke `koka`:
```
$ koka --version
```
Koka is by default installed for the current user in `<prefix>/bin/koka`,
(with architecture specific files under `<prefix>/lib/koka/v2.x.x`
and libraries and samples under `<prefix>/share/koka/v2.x.x`).
On Unix and macOS the default prefix is `/usr/local` while
on Windows the default prefix is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\koka`



# Benchmarks

These are initial benchmarks of Koka v2 with [Perceus] reference counting
versus state-of-the-art memory reclamation implementations in
various other languages. Since we compare across languages we need to
interpret these results with care -- the results depend not only on memory
reclamation but also on the different optimizations performed by each
compiler and how well we can translate each benchmark to that particular
language. We view these results therefore mostly as _evidence that the
current Koka implementation of reference counting is viable and can be competitive_
and _not_ as a direct comparison of absolute performance between languages and systems.

As such, we select here only benchmarks that stress memory allocation, and
we tried to select mature comparison systems that use a range of memory
reclamation techniques and are considered best-in-class. The systems we
compare are, Koka 2.0.3 (compiling the generated C code with gcc 9.3.0),
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org) 4.08.1, [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) GHC 8.6.5,
[Swift](https://swift.org/) 5.3, [Java](https://www.java.com) SE 15.0.1 with the Hotspot G1 collector,
and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.org) gcc 9.3.0.

<img align="right" width="400" src="doc/bench-amd3600-nov-2020.png" style="border:1px solid black">

The benchmarks are all available in [`test/bench`](test/bench) (see the
readme there for build instructions), and all
stress memory allocation with little computation:
`rbtree` (inserts 42 million items into a red-black tree),
`rbtree-ck` (a variant of `rbtree` that keeps a list of every 5th
subtree and thus shares many subtrees), `deriv`
(the symbolic derivative of a large expression),
`nqueens` (calculates all solutions for the n-queens problem of size 13
into a list, and returns the length of that list where the solution lists
share many sub-solutions), and `cfold` (constant-folding over a large symbolic expression).

Note: in C++, without automatic memory management, many benchmarks are
difficult to express directly as they use persistent and
partially shared data structures. To implement these faithfully would
essentially require manual reference counting. Instead, we use C++ as
our performance baseline: we either use in-place updates
without supporting persistence (as in `rbtree` which uses ``std::map``)
or we do not reclaim memory at all (as in `deriv`, `nqueens`, and `cfold`).

The execution times and peak working set averaged over 10 runs and normalized to Koka are in
the figure on the right (on a 3.8Ghz AMD3600XT on Ubuntu 20.04, Nov 2020).

We can see that even though Koka has currently few
optimizations besides the reference counting ones, it performs very well
compared to these mature systems, often outperforming by a significant
margin -- both in execution time and peak working set.
Clearly, these benchmarks are allocation heavy but it is encouraging
to see this initial performance from Koka.

A full discussion of these benchmarks and systems can be found
in the [Perceus] report.


# Tasks

Please help develop Koka: there are many opportunities to improve Koka or do research with Koka. We need:

- [ ] Emacs (partially done) and Vim syntax highlighting.
- [ ] Add more samples, improve documentation, landing page etc. Make it easier for people to contribute.
- [ ] Many library modules are incomplete (like `std/os/file`) or missing (like `std/data/map`).
- [ ] Update file and os primitives for the JavaScript backend.
- [x] Run the full test suite.
- [x] Run the Bayesian probalistic machine learning program with large parameters.
- [x] Functions with a pattern match in the argument (by Steven Fontanella).
- [x] Support `int64` operations

More advanced projects:

- [x] Update the JavaScript backend to 1) use modern modules instead of amdefine, 2) use the new bigints instead of 
  bigint.js, and 3) add support for int64. (landed in the `dev` branch)
- [x] Port `std/text/regex` from v1 (using PCRE)
- [ ] A language server for Visual Studio Code and Atom. Koka can already generate a 
  typed [range map](src/Syntax/RangeMap.hs) so this should be managable. Partially done: see PR #100 (by @fwcd) -- it just
  needs work on packaging it to make it easy to build and install as part of the Koka installer.
- [ ] Package management of Koka modules.
- [x] Compile to WASM (using emscripten on the current C backend)
- [ ] Extend TRMC to include (1) return results with pairs (like `unzip` or `partition`), (2) associative functions
      (like `+` in `length`), and (3) mutually recursive functions.
- [ ] Improve compilation of local state to use local variables directly (in C) without allocation. Tricky though due to multiple resumptions.
- [ ] Improve performance of array/mutable reference programming. Koka is has great performance for
      algebraic datatypes but lags when using more imperative array algorithms. This requires better
      integration with the reference counting (faster in-place update for vectors) and integration local mutable references.
- [ ] To support optimal Btree's we need _mutable fields_ in constructors, and perhaps intrusive vector fields.
- [ ] The current parallel task support is very basic; we need a great work-stealing thread pool, LVar's etc.
- [ ] Expose the "bytes" primitive data together with views..
- [ ] Improve C code generation by identifying output that could be better; also in effectful code we generate many join-points (see [9]),
      can we increase the sharing/reduce the extra code.
- [ ] The compiler always analyses module dependencies and builds any needed dependencies. The current code 
      (in `src/Compiler/Compile.hs`) is not great and it would be nice to factorize the "make" functionality out 
      and also allow for parallel builds.

Master/PhD level:

- [ ] Better language level FBIP support with guaranteed datatype matching, automatic derivative and visitor generation.
- [ ] Can we use C++ exceptions to implement "zero-cost" `if yielding() ...` branches and remove the need join points (see [9]).
- [x] Float up `open` calls to improve effect handling (worked on by Naoya Furudono)
- [x] Formalize opening and closing effect row types (worked on by Kazuki Ikemori)

Currently being worked on:

- [x] Various standard optimizations like case-of-case, join points, case-of-known constructor, etc.
- [x] Implement inline specialization where functions like `map`, `fold` etc get specialized for the function 
  with which they are called. This is an important optimization for functional style languages to reduce the allocation of lambda's.
  (contact: Steven Fontanella)
- [x] Borrowing analysis for Perceus and improved reuse analysis. (contact: Anton Lorenzen)
- [ ] Improve case-of-known simplification with shape information

The following is the immediate todo list to be completed in the coming months:

- [ ] Port `std/async` (using `libuv`).
- [ ] Proper overloading with (a form of) type classes. (in design phase).

Contact me if you are interested in tackling some of these :-)


# Build Notes

## Branches

The main development branches are:
- `master`: latest stable version.
- `dev`: current development branch -- submit PR's to this branch.
- `v1-master`: last stable version of Koka v1: this is Koka with the Javascript (and C#)
  backend which does not use evidence translation.
  This version supports `std/async` and should compile examples from published papers.

## Building on macOS M1

Currently (Dec 2021) you need to use `brew install haskell-stack --head` 
to get the latest `2.7.4` version of stack. (Have patience as the cabal
install step takes about 20 min). Moreover, you need to add the `brew`
installed LLVM to your path afterwards, or otherwise stack cannot find the LLVM tools.
Add the following to your `~/.zshrc` script and open an fresh prompt:
```
export PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH
```

<!--
Moreover, sometimes `stack` segfaults but running it inside `bash` seems to resolve the issue.
Also, we need to tell stack to use the system installed ghc and skip the version check as
it can currently not install GHC for arm64 yet:
```
bash:~$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/koka-lang/koka
bash:~$ cd koka
bash:~/koka$ stack --system-ghc --skip-ghc-check build
bash:~/koka$ stack --system-ghc --skip-ghc-check exec koka
```

and pass the `--system-ghc` flag to create an installation bundle as well:
```
bash:~/koka$ stack --system-ghc --skip-ghc-check exec koka -- -e util/bundle -- --system-ghc
```
-->

## Building with Cabal 

Some platforms (like Linux arm64 and FreeBSD) do not 
always support `stack` well. In these cases we can also
use `ghc` and `cabal` directly. Install these packages as:
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ghc cabal-install
```
On macOS (x64 and arm64) we use `brew` instead:
```
$ brew install pkg-config ghc cabal-install
```
On FreeBSD, use `pkg`:
```
$ sudo pkg update
$ sudo pkg install ghc hs-cabal-install   # or: hs-haskell-platform
```
Optionally, install `vcpkg` as well. If you
install this in the `~/vcpkg` directory Koka will find
it automatically when needed:
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg
~$ ./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
~$ vcpkg/vcpkg install pcre           
```

We can now build the compiler using `cabal` as:
```
~$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/koka-lang/koka
~$ cd koka
~/koka$ cabal new-update
~/koka$ cabal new-build
~/koka$ cabal new-run koka
```

We can also run tests as: 
```
~/koka$ cabal new-run koka-test
```

or create an installer:
```
~/koka$ cabal new-run koka -- -e util/bundle
```

## Building with minbuild

If neither `stack` nor `cabal` are functional, you may try to 
run the minimal build script to build Koka:
```
~/koka$ ./util/minbuild.sh
```
which directly invokes `ghc` to build the compiler.
You can create an install bundle from a minbuild as:
```
~/koka$ .koka/minbuild/koka -e util/bundle.kk -- --koka=.koka/minbuild/koka
```


## Windows C Compilers

The Koka compiler on Windows requires a C compiler. By default
when using `stack exec koka` the C compiler supplied with `ghc` is used (`mingw`)
but that is only visible within a stack environmet.

It is therefore recommended to install the [clang][winclang] compiler for
Windows (which is automatically installed when running `util/install.bat`).
However, Koka can also use the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler (`cl`) if you 
run `koka` from a [Visual Studio x64 toolset](vsprompt) command prompt (in 
order to link correctly with the Windows system libraries).

Generally, for Koka code, `mingw` (`gcc`) optimizes best, closely followed `clang-cl`.
On a 3.8Gz AMD 3600XT, with `mingw` 7.2.0, `clang-cl` 11.0.0, and `cl` 19.28 we get:
```
$ stack exec out\v2.0.5\mingw-release\test_bench_koka_rbtree -- --kktime
420000
info: elapsed: 0.624s, user: 0.625s, sys: 0.000s, rss: 163mb

$ out\v2.0.5\clang-cl-release\test_bench_koka_rbtree --kktime
420000
info: elapsed: 0.727s, user: 0.734s, sys: 0.000s, rss: 164mb

$ out\v2.0.5\cl-release\test_bench_koka_rbtree --kktime
420000
info: elapsed: 1.483s, user: 1.484s, sys: 0.000s, rss: 164mb
```
