* 2021-09-01 (pinned) The ICFP'21 tutorial
  "_Programming with Effect Handlers and FBIP in Koka_" is now available on 
  [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6OFhD_mHtKA).

* 2021-12-27: Koka v2.3.8 released: improved `int` performance, various bug fixes, update wasm backend, 
  initial conan support, fix js backend.

* 2021-11-26: Koka v2.3.6 released: 
  `maybe`-like types are already value types, but now also no longer need heap allocation 
  if not nested (and `[Just(1)]` uses the same heap space as `[1]`),
  improved atomic refcounting (by Anton Lorenzen), improved specialization (by Steven Fontanella),
  various small fixes, add `std/os/readline`, fix build on freeBSD  

* 2021-10-15: Koka v2.3.2 released, with initial wasm support 
  (use `--target=wasm`, and install [emscripten] and [wasmtime]), 
  improved reuse specialization (by Anton Lorenzen), and various bug fixes.

* 2021-09-29: Koka v2.3.1 released, with improved TRMC optimizations, and improved reuse 
  (the rbtree benchmark is as fast as C++ now), and 
  faster effect operations. Experimental: allow elision of `->` in anonymous
  function expressions (e.g. `xs.map( fn(x) x + 1 )`) and operation clauses.
  Command line options changed a bit with ``.koka`` as the standard output directory.  

* 2021-09-20: Koka v2.3.0 released, with new 
  [brace elision](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#sec-layout) and if/match
  conditions without parenthesis. Updated the javascript backend
  using ES6 modules and BigInt. new `module std/num/int64`, improved effect operation performance.

* 2021-09-05: Koka v2.2.1 released, with initial parallel tasks, the binary-trees benchmark, and
  [brace elision](https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#sec-layout).

* 2021-08-26: Koka v2.2.0 released, improved simplification (by Rashika B), cross-module specialization (Steven Fontanella),
  and borrowing annotations with improved reuse analysis (Anton Lorenzen).

* 2021-08-26: At 12:30 EST was the live Koka tutorial at
  [ICFP'21](https://icfp21.sigplan.org/details/icfp-2021-tutorials/5/Programming-with-Effect-Handlers-and-FBIP-in-Koka),
